Our project is a recipe recommender system that suggests personalized recipes based on user preferences such as dietary needs, available ingredients, total time, and the rating of the recipe out of 5 stars. We used a mix of filtering and sorting based around the userâ€™s preferences. We developed the system into a website where the user can interact with a different set of preferences, which help users discover new recipes that match their needs and constraints.
